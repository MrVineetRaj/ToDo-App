# TODO web application by Vineet Raj
Used React along with redux and redux toolkit for this project. In this web application I created a ToDo app,
to try this web application you can directly go to [Link](https://todoforvineet.netlify.app/)

Or if you want to run this program on localhost then you sould try using these command

<ul>
  <li>open this program in your VS code</li>
  <li>stay in the forlde that contains -public , src and other files</li>
  <li>run command " npm install "</li>
  <li>then " run npm dev "</li>
  <li>in terminal you will find a link  from your localhost server to see this program</li>
</ul>

Hope you liked this project !
